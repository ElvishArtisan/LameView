QT-4 NOTES
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environmental
variables be set prior to running ./configure in order for Qt 4 to be detected
properly.  Some known case are:

CentOS/RedHat:  export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH
